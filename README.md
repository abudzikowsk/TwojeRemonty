#### Concept
A prototype of the game focused on avoiding enemies and collecting items that improve the player's condition.

#### Game
The main mechanic focuses on using the foreground observation in order to overtake the enemies patrolling the scene and collecting the necessary items.
Combat is all about firing missiles at enemies, which automatically triggers a response and attack.

#### Interface
The movement control mechanism is based on the WASD keys or the arrow keys. The space bar is used for shooting. Collecting items is done through collisions with them. A simple window displays the number of items collected, the remaining ammunition and a bar indicating the player's condition.

#### Visual style
Game style and character appeariance will be based on core objects GameObjects. If necessary, simple objects can be replaced with 3D models or terrain simulating environments.
