#### Concept
An application connecting principals and contractors of the homebuilding & renovation industry. Contractors can offer their services in the form of an offer on the board, placing their name, minimum and maximum price for the service there, along with a description and a photo gallery of exemplary implementations. The principal may issue a opinion for the work performed by contractors. The user has the option of using the search and applying filters to narrow down the search. The application supports individual user accounts, both for contractors and principals. The application provides an administrator panel that allows you to manage the application.
